# Homebrew formula for ccm.
#
# This file is the source of truth; the release workflow rewrites the version
# and checksums here and mirrors it into the tap repository. Install with:
#
#   brew install MAbbasRaza/tap/ccm
#
# The binaries are prebuilt rather than compiled from source so that installing
# does not require a Go toolchain.

      Get started:

        ccm init            pin your Claude Code config directory
        ccm add work        save the account you are signed into now

      Capture your current account BEFORE running /logout in Claude Code.
      Logging out destroys the refresh token there would be nothing left to save.
